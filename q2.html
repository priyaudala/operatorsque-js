    Question 2:
    Create a program that accepts the user's first name, last name, and age as inputs. The program should:
    
    Concatenate the first and last name to display the full name.
    
    Use a ternary operator to check if the user is 18 or older and display a message indicating whether they are eligible to vote.
    
    Use a string operator to calculate the length of the full name and log whether the name is longer than 10 characters.

        let ln = prompt("enter your last name:");
        let age = Number(prompt("enter your age:"));
        console.log('your full name is ', fn + " " + ln);
        age > 18 ? console.log('you are eligible to vote') : console.log('you are not eligible to vote');
        let fullname = fn + ln;
        fullname.length > 10 ? console.log('the name is longer than 10 characters') : console.log('the name is not longer than 10 characters');
