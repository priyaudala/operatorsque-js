        Question 4:
Write a program that takes three numbers from the user. The program should:
Add the first two numbers and display the result.
Compare the sum of the first two numbers with the third number using comparison operators.
Use a logical operator (&&) to check if the sum of the first two numbers is greater than 50 and the third number is less than 100, and log the result.
