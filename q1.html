    Question 1
    Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. Perform the following:
    Add, subtract, multiply, and divide the two numbers using arithmetic operators.
    
    Compare the two numbers using comparison operators (>, <, ==) and log the result.
    
    Use an assignment operator (+=) to add 5 to the first number and log the updated value.
