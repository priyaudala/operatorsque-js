        Question 6:
Write a program that simulates a shopping cart:
Ask the user to input the total amount.
Use a ternary operator to apply a 15% discount if the total is over $150; otherwise, apply no discount.
Use assignment operators to update the total amount after the discount and log the final price.

        totalAmount >= 150 ? console.log('15% discount applied') : console.log('discount is not applied');
        let newprice = (15 / 100) * totalAmount;
