        Question 10:
Write a program that calculates the total score of a student based on three input scores:
Add the scores using arithmetic operators.
Use a ternary operator to check if the total score is 60 or above to display "Passed" or "Failed."
Use assignment operators to add bonus points (5) to the total score if itâ€™s below 60, then recheck if the student has passed or failed after applying the bonus.
