        Question 9:
Create a program that evaluates a person’s eligibility for a loan. The program should:
Ask for the person’s age, salary, and credit score.
Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check if the person is eligible for a loan (e.g., age ≥ 21, salary > $30,000, or credit score > 650).
Log whether the person is approved or denied based on these conditions.
